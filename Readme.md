🚀 Petrol Pump Sales Forecasting & Revenue Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes weekly fuel price data to simulate petrol pump sales, revenue, and profit trends. Using Python for data preprocessing and business modeling, and Tableau for visualization, the project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow.

The objective is to understand how fuel price fluctuations impact fuel demand and overall business profitability.

🎯 Problem Statement

Fuel prices fluctuate weekly due to market conditions, taxes, and global oil trends. Petrol pump businesses must understand:

How price changes affect sales volume

Revenue and profit behavior over time

The relationship between fuel price and customer demand

This project models and visualizes these business dynamics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & transformation

NumPy – Synthetic demand modeling

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Tableau Public – Interactive dashboard creation

Git & GitHub – Version control and project hosting

📂 Dataset

Weekly fuel price dataset

Missing values handled using forward filling

Date formatting and sorting applied

Cleaned column naming for better analysis

Synthetic sales data was generated using a price-demand elasticity assumption to simulate real-world petrol pump operations.
